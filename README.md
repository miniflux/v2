[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/miniflux/miniflux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/miniflux/miniflux)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/miniflux/badge/?version=latest)](https://docs.miniflux.net/)

Miniflux is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader:

- Written in Go (Golang)
- Works only with Postgresql
- Doesn't use any ORM
- Doesn't use any complicated framework
- Use only modern vanilla Javascript (ES6 and Fetch API)
- The number of features is volountary limited

It's simple, fast, lightweight and super easy to install.

Miniflux 2 is a rewrite of [Miniflux 1.x](https://github.com/miniflux/miniflux-legacy) in Golang.

Notes
-----

Miniflux 2 still in development and **it's not ready to use**.
