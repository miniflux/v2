Version 2.1.1 (March 10, 2024)
-----------------------------

* Move search form to a dedicated page
* Add Readeck integration
* Add feed option to disable HTTP/2 to avoid fingerprinting
* Add `Enter` key as a hotkey to open selected item
* Proxify `video` element `poster` attribute
* Add a couple of new possible locations for feeds
    * Hugo likes to generate `index.xml`
    * `feed.atom` and `feed.rss` are used by enterprise-scale/old-school gigantic CMS
* Fix categories import from Thunderbird's OPML
* Fix logo misalignment when using languages that are more verbose than English
* Google Reader: Do not return a 500 error when no items is returned
* Handle RDF feeds with duplicated `<title>` elements
* Sort integrations alphabetically
* Add more URL validation in media proxy
* Add unit test to ensure each translation has the correct number of plurals
* Add missing plurals for some languages
* Makefile: quiet `git describe` and `rev-parse` stderr: When building from a tarball instead of a cloned git repo, there would be two `fatal: not a git repository` errors emitted even though the build succeeds. This is because of how `VERSION` and `COMMIT` are set in the Makefile. This PR suppresses the stderr for these variable assignments.
* Makefile: do not force `CGO_ENABLED=0` for `miniflux` target
* Add GitHub Action pipeline to build packages on-demand
* Remove Golint (deprecated), use `staticcheck` and `golangci-lint` instead
* Build amd64/arm64 Debian packages with CGO disabled
* Update `go.mod` and add `.exe` suffix to Windows binary
* Add a couple of fuzzers
* Fix CodeQL workflow
* Code and performance improvements:
    * Use an `io.ReadSeeker` instead of an `io.Reader` to parse feeds
    * Speed up the sanitizer:
        - Allow Youtube URLs to start with `www`
        - Use `strings.Builder` instead of a `bytes.Buffer`
        - Use a `strings.NewReader` instead of a `bytes.NewBufferString`
        - Sprinkles a couple of `continue` to make the code-flow more obvious
        - Inline calls to `inList`, and put their parameters in the right order
        - Simplify `isPixelTracker`
        - Simplify `isValidIframeSource`, by extracting the hostname and comparing it directly, instead of using the full url and checking if it starts with multiple variations of the same one (`//`, `http:`, `https://` multiplied by `/www.`)
        - Add a benchmark
        - Instead of having to allocate a ~100 keys map containing possibly dynamic values (at least to the go compiler), allocate it once in a global variable. This significantly speeds things up, by reducing the garbage
        - Use constant time access for maps instead of iterating on them
        - Build a ~large whitelist map inline instead of constructing it item by item (and remove a duplicate key/value pair)
        - Use `slices` instead of hand-rolled loops
    collector/allocator involvements.
    * Reuse a `Reader` instead of copying to a buffer when parsing an Atom feed
    * Preallocate memory when exporting to OPML: This should marginally increase performance when exporting a large amount of feeds to OPML
    * Delay call of `view.New` after logging the user in: There is no need to do extra work like creating a session and its associated view until the user has been properly identified and as many possibly-failing sql request have been successfully run
    * Use constant-time comparison for anti-csrf tokens: This is probably completely overkill, but since anti-csrf tokens are secrets, they should be compared against untrusted inputs in constant time
    * Simplify and optimize `genericProxyRewriter`
        - Reduce the amount of nested loops: it's preferable to search the whole page once and filter on it (even with filters that should always be false), than searching it again for every element we're looking for.
        - Factorize the proxying conditions into a `shouldProxy` function to reduce the copy-pasta.
    * Speed up `removeUnlikelyCandidates`: `.Not` returns a brand new `Selection`, copied element by element
    * Improve `EstimateReadingTime`'s speed by a factor 7
        - Refactorise the tests and add some
        - Use 250 signs instead of the whole text
        - Only check for Korean, Chinese and Japanese script
        - Add a benchmark
        - Use a more idiomatic control flow
    * Don't compute reading-time when unused: If the user doesn't display reading times, there is no need to compute them. This should speed things up a bit, since `whatlanggo.Detect` is abysmally slow.
    * Simplify `username` generation for the integration tests: No need to generate random numbers 10 times, generate a single big-enough one. A single int64 should be more than enough
    * Add missing regex anchor detected by CodeQL
    * Don't mix up slices capacity and length
    * Use prepared statements for intervals, `ArchiveEntries` and `updateEnclosures`
    * Use modern for-loops introduced with Go 1.22
    * Remove a superfluous condition: No need to check if the length of `line` is positive since we're checking afterwards that it contains the `=` sign
    * Close resources as soon as possible, instead of using `defer()` in a loop
    * Remove superfluous escaping in a regex
    * Use `strings.ReplaceAll` instead of `strings.Replace(…, -1)`
    * Use `strings.EqualFold` instead of `strings.ToLower(…) ==`
    * Use `.WriteString(` instead of `.Write([]byte(…`
    * Use `%q` instead of `"%s"`
    * Make `internal/worker/worker.go` read-only
    * Use a switch-case construct in `internal/locale/plural.go` instead of an avalanche of `if`
    * Template functions: simplify `formatFileSize` and `duration` implementation
    * Inline some templating functions
    * Make use of `printer.Print` when possible
    * Add a `printer.Print` to `internal/locale/printer.go`: No need to use variadic functions with string format interpolation to generate static strings
    * Minor code simplification in `internal/ui/view/view.go`: No need to create the map item by item when we can create it in one go
    * Build the map inline in `CountAllFeeds()`: No need to build an empty map to then add more fields in it one by one
    * Miscellaneous improvements to `internal/reader/subscription/finder.go`:
        - Surface `localizedError` in `FindSubscriptionsFromWellKnownURLs` via `slog`
        - Use an inline declaration for new subscriptions, like done elsewhere in the
        file, if only for consistency's sake
        - Preallocate the `subscriptions` slice when using an RSS-bridge,
    * Use an update-where for `MarkCategoryAsRead` instead of a subquery
    * Simplify `CleanOldUserSessions`' query: No need for a subquery, filtering on `created_at` directly is enough
    * Simplify `cleanupEntries`' query
        - `NOT (hash=ANY(%4))` can be expressed as `hash NOT IN $4`
        - There is no need for a subquery operating on the same table, moving the conditions out is equivalent.
    * Reformat `ArchiveEntries`'s query for consistency's sake and replace the `=ANY` with an `IN`
    * Reformat the query in `GetEntryIDs` and `GetReadTime`'s query for consistency's sake
    * Simplify `WeeklyFeedEntryCount`: No need for a `BETWEEN`: we want to filter on entries published in the last week, no need to express is as "entries published between now and last week", "entries published after last week" is enough
    * Add some tests for `add_image_title`
    * Remove `github.com/google/uuid` dependencies: Replace it with a hand-rolled implementation. Heck, an UUID isn't even a requirement according to Omnivore API docs
    * Simplify `internal/reader/icon/finder.go`:
        - Use a simple regex to parse data uri instead of a hand-rolled parser, and document what fields are considered mandatory.
        - Use case-insensitive matching to find (fav)icons, instead of doing the same query twice with different letter cases
        - Add `apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png` as a fallback `favicon`
        - Reorder the queries to have `icon` first, since it seems to be the most popular one. It used to be last, meaning that pages had to be parsed completely 4 times, instead of one now.
        - Minor factorisation in `findIconURLsFromHTMLDocument`
    * Small refactoring of `internal/reader/date/parser.go`:
        - Split dates formats into those that require local times and those who don't, so that there is no need to have a switch-case in the for loop with around 250 iterations at most.
        - Be more strict when it comes to timezones, previously invalid ones like -13 were accepted. Also add a test for this.
        - Bail out early if the date is an empty string.
    * Make use of Go ≥ 1.21 slices package instead of hand-rolled loops
    * Reorder the fields of the `Entry` struct to save some memory
* Dependencies update:
    * Bump `golang.org/x/oauth2` from `0.17.0` to `0.18.0`

* Add swipe as option for gesture navigation between entries. There are now 3 possible choices: `none`, `double-tap`, and `swipe`.
* Prefer typographic punctuation in English translation
* Process older entries first:
    - Feed entries are usually ordered from most to least recent.
    - Processing older entries first ensures that their creation timestamp
    is lower than that of newer entries.
    - This is useful when we order by creation, because then we get a
    consistent timeline.
* Fix Grafana dashboard
* Push Docker images to `Quay.io` (RedHat)
* Bump `golang.org/x/*`, `github.com/lib/pq`, `mvdan.cc/xurls/v2` and `github.com/prometheus/client_golang` dependencies

Version 2.0.43 (March 16, 2023)
-------------------------------

* Avoid XSS when opening a broken image due to unescaped ServerError in proxy handler (CVE-2023-27592)

    Creating an RSS feed item with the inline description containing an `<img>` tag
    with a `srcset` attribute pointing to an invalid URL like
    `http:a<script>alert(1)</script>`, we can coerce the proxy handler into an error
    condition where the invalid URL is returned unescaped and in full.

    This results in JavaScript execution on the Miniflux instance as soon as the
    user is convinced to open the broken image.

* Use `r.RemoteAddr` to check `/metrics` endpoint network access (CVE-2023-27591)

    HTTP headers like `X-Forwarded-For` or `X-Real-Ip` can be easily spoofed. As
    such, it cannot be used to test if the client IP is allowed.

    The recommendation is to use HTTP Basic authentication to protect the
    metrics endpoint, or run Miniflux behind a trusted reverse-proxy.

* Add HTTP Basic authentication for `/metrics` endpoint
* Add proxy support for several media types
* Parse feed categories from RSS, Atom and JSON feeds

    - Remove deprecated `version` element
* Update scraping rules for `ilpost.it`
* Bump `github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery` from `1.8.0` to `1.8.1`
* Bump `github.com/tdewolff/minify/v2` from `2.12.4` to `2.12.5`
* Bump `github.com/yuin/goldmark` from `1.5.3` to `1.5.4`

* Disable double-tap mobile gesture if swipe gesture is disabled
* Skip integrations if there are no entries to push
* Enable TLS-ALPN-01 challenge for ACME
    - This type of challenge works purely at the TLS layer and is compatible
    with SNI proxies. The existing HTTP-01 challenge support has been left
    as-is.
